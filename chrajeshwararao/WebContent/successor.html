									Dr. Ramesh Chennamaneni has been active in development work since the beginning of 1990 in Siricilla region of Karimnager district. In his stay of 20 years in India before he left for Germany, he was a witness of a number of social changes and development problems in Karimnager district. This has been possible because of he being the son of  Sri. Ch. Rajeshwara Rao, freedom fighter and an ardent organizer and supporter of people,s movements in Telangana region. Among others, it is under the leadership of  Sri Ch. Rajeshwara Rao about 25 lakh tenants of the Telangana region could become owner farmers.
									<br/><br/>
									After completing his studies and doctoral work in Germany, Dr. Ramesh has set up an NGO in Germany along with a large group of young people to help his motherland. It was the abject poverty, lack of basic amenities and lack of collective action in the region which made him to find solutions for a number of problems along with local people. Dr. Ramesh could convince 138 villages and the people there to join hands in solving the drinking water problem. About 2 lakh people in Sircilla region could be provided with drinking water. This agenda was basically set by women. Their second agenda was improvement of school infrastructure. In about 180 villages school buildings (4 junior colleges), sanitation facilities, furniture and science equipment were provided with peoples participation. The fact that 75 000 people of Sircilla gets drinking water today lies in the

									Indo-German Project implemented right in the beginning of ninetees. New Water works in Manair and a Overhead tank with one million liter capacity stand today as a living example of consistent development efforts. It is the credit of Dr. Ramesh that Vemulawada town has an excellent drainage system(26,000 meters) effectively functioning today. The fact that Vemulawada Gudi Cheruvu has plenty of water is the result of recently completed feeder channel from Mula Vaagu, which also goes to his credit.

					<p>Also in providing irrigation facilities, resource management, self employment schemes excellent results have been achieved. Tens and thousands of people have found sustainable livelihoods (see projects list as Annex). For example, in one of the most backward Sanugula village in Chandurthy mandal, one Crore was spend to make this village a model one. Irrigation facilities, watershed development, drinking water and education facilities made the villagers not only to stay in their own village but also those who migrated to Gulf have returned back to make their village their permanent home. Self employment was created through carpenter societies, powerloom societies, small scale irrigation and thrift groups. In one of the recent programmes, all villages in the region are going to get their own purified drinking water plants so that they can supply their populations at 2 Rs per 20 Liters of purified Water. This successful scheme is presently supplying 65 000 people with excellent quality of water, which is also affordable to agricultural labourers and artisans.</p>
					<p>Given this background and a strong political and social commitment for his people and his Telangana region, Dr. Ramesh Chennamaneni has decided to enter practical politics. Achieving Telangana state and Reconstruction of Telangana are the key focus areas where he proposes to contribute actively in the future. At a time when politics have indeed become a very hard terrain, all the young generation, elderly and experienced has strongly supported him to become the MLA for Vemulawada constituencty.</p>
					<p>Dr. Ramesh Chenamaneni, entered into active politics in the year 2009 as a successor to Sri Ch. Rajeshwars Rao garu. He is presently serving as the MLA of Vemulawada constituenty, continuosly offering his services.</p>
